## Federated Time-Series Forecasting
This is the code accompanying the submission to the [Federated Traffic Prediction for 5G and Beyond Challenge](https://supercom.cttc.es/index.php/ai-challenge-2022) of the [Euclid](https://euclid.ee.duth.gr/) team and the corresponding paper entitled "Federated Learning for 5G Base Station Traffic Forecasting" by Vasileios Perifanis, Nikolaos Pavlidis, Remous-Aris Koutsiamanis, Pavlos S. Efraimidis, 2022.

---

This code can serve as benchmark for federated time-series forecasting. 
We focus on raw LTE data and train a global federated model using the measurements of three different base stations on different time intervals. 
Specifically, we implement 6 different model architectures (MLP, RNN, LSTM, GRU, CNN, Dual-Attention LSTM Autoencoder)
and 9 different federated aggregation algorithms (SimpleAvg, MedianAvg, FedAvg, FedProx, FedAvgM, FedNova, FedAdagrad, FedYogi, FedAdam)
on a non-iid setting with distribution, quantity and temporal skew.

### Installation

We recommend using a conda environment with Python 3.8

1. First install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
```
$ conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

2. Install additional dependencies
```
$ pip install pandas scikit_learn matplotlib seaborn colorcet scipy h5py carbontracker notebook
```

You can also use the requirements' specification:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
